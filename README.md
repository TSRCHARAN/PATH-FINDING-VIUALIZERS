# PATH-FINDING-VIUALIZERS

Developed a Path Finding Visualizer which visulaize the best path between Source and Destination which might have some barriers/blocks in between.

Implemented A* Star Path Finding Algorithm and Dijkstra's Path Finding Algorithm for path finding

Color Representations - 
Orange - Source
Blue - Destination
Black - Barriers / Blocks
Green - Path currently to be explored
Red - Path already explored
Pink - Optimal Path between Source and Destination
