# PATH-FINDING-VIUALIZERS

Developed a Path Finding Visualizer which visulaize the best path between Source and Destination which might have some barriers/blocks in between.

Implemented A* Star Path Finding Algorithm and Dijkstra's Path Finding Algorithm for path finding

Color Representations :\n
Orange - Source\n
Blue - Destination\n
Black - Barriers / Blocks\n
Green - Path currently to be explored\n
Red - Path already explored\n
Pink - Optimal Path between Source and Destination
