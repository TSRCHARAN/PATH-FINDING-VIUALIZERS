# PATH-FINDING-VIUALIZERS

Developed a Path Finding Visualizer which visulaize the best path between Source and Destination which might have some barriers/blocks in between.

Implemented A* Star Path Finding Algorithm and Dijkstra's Path Finding Algorithm for path finding

Color Representations Used

Orange - Source

Blue - Destination

Black - Barriers / Blocks

Green - Path currently to be explored

Red - Path already explored

Pink - Optimal Path between Source and Destination
